This file contains a general description of my Webcam Piano application

=======================================================================

Further development ideas:

1) Mouse left click to play Piano sound file

2) Play random notes upon movement detected

3) Slider to adjust sensitivity of movement detection

Additional notes:

- Piano file will always play at an instance of left click so spamming left click will cause overlapping of instances

- there's an additional sparkle effect upon moving
